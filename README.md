Telecom Industry Customer churn

Python-Data Analytics Project For Resume

Here, we have analyzed the dataset of an European Telecom Company.

This Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription.

We explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

Business Understanding Of A Telecom Industry Customer Churn:

Customer chum is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concerns for the Telecom industry

The effect on the revenues of the companies, because of this customer chums is huge, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer chum

In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual chum rate, and it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition

Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer chum is important to take necessary actions to reduce this chum

The main goal of our project is to develop an understanding of the cause of customer churn which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn, and what to do to retain the most valuable customer.

We will find how we can maxmize the profit by retaining customer, and, how we can reduce the chum rate by identifying the issues
